# Intercom home test

# 1.Technical problem


We have some customer records in a text file (customers.txt) -- one customer per line, JSON lines formatted. We want to invite any customer within 100km of our Dublin office for some food and drinks on us. Write a program that will read the full list of customers and output the names and user ids of matching customers (within 100km), sorted by User ID (ascending).
  - You must use the first formula from [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-circle_distance) to calculate distance. Don't forget, you'll need to convert degrees to radians.
  - The GPS coordinates for our Dublin office are 53.339428, -6.257664.
  - You can find the Customer list [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/intercom-take-home-test/customers.txt).

# 2. Proudest Achievement

My proudest achievement is the strength and confidence I gained from fighting cancer while working.
During the hardest time of my life when everyone suggested that I take a break and rest, I decided not to give up but to fight and work simultaneously.
Of course, it was challenging both mentally and physically especially during chemotherapy. However,  I knew that life doesn't have a break, so I learned to fight harder and make the most out of daily life.
At work, this improved my problem-solving ability and made me focus more on code quality and the delivery of my tasks.
